It thus has a linear complexity O(n). Although it may sound fast, but as the number of data points grow larger this time becomes very noticable. because ve run O(n) computation at each iteration. but the number of iterations may vary. <br>\n",
    "On the other hand, K-Means has a couple of disadvantages. Firstly, you have to select how many groups/classes there are. This isn’t always trivial and ideally with a clustering algorithm we’d want it to figure those out for us because the point of it is to gain some insight from the data. K-means also starts with a random choice of cluster centers and therefore it may yield different clustering results on different runs of the algorithm. Thus, the results may not be repeatable and lack consistency. Other cluster methods are more consistent. It is also sensitive to outliers.\n",
